              <b>Abstract:</b> Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in generating human-like text. However, the persuasiveness of the generated text remains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose a novel framework to measure the persuasiveness of LLMs. We show that LLMs can be used to generate persuasive text, and that the persuasiveness of the generated text can be measured using human evaluations
              and automated metrics. We find that LLMs can generate text that is as persuasive as human-written text, and that the persuasiveness of the generated text can be improved by fine-tuning the LLMs on a small amount of labeled data. Our work highlights the opportunities and risks of automated persuasion, and suggests that LLMs can be used to generate persuasive text for a wide range of applications.
