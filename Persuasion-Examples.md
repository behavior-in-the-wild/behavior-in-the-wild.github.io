Von Frisch’s work with the waggle dances of honeybees represents one of the first empirically validated examples of non-mammals using sophisticated non-verbal communication where dance movements are symbolically interpreted as a descriptive “language” that uses an iconic relationship to the geographic location of a food source. 

broken wing displays performed by adult birds of various genera, which create the false impression for a nearby predator that the bird is injured, and thus an easy target. This allows the bird to lead the predator away from vulnerable chicks (Griffin, 2001, p. 222).


In the case of chimpanzees in one facility where all of the chimps were taught American Sign Language, two new chimps were brought in, and through no human prompting, were taught sign language by the existing community (Fouts et al., 2002). This second generation of chimps became so reliant on the sign language that they would even use it during periods of high tension or aggravation, like when fighting or engaging in rowdy play, when one would expect them to resort to more “natural” chimpanzee forms of communication (Fouts et al., 2002, p. 288)




George Kennedy, who was among the first to revive interest in
nonhuman animal communication among rhetoricians, famously describes the various stages
of a red deer fight in order to highlight the possibilities of analogy when studying persuasive
communication across species lines (Kennedy, 1998, pp. 13–14).
So how do the minds of red deer stags in rut operate? At first the stags will adopt a low-stakes
communicative behavior – they will simply bugle at one another in an attempt to run off lesser
competitors for the does. If several rounds of these vocal calls do not work, the bucks enter a
series of motions where they turn and walk at right angles to one another, then turn and strut
again at another right angle, repeating this process several times as if they were “displaying the
goods” to their potential opponents. Perhaps the thinking is that if one stag is obviously larger
and more muscular it will be easier to scare off other suitors. It is only after these attempts at
persuasive communication have failed, which happens less than a third of the time, that either
deer will initiate a physical conflict. We can thus infer that these display rituals are embraced
by most members of a herd because they are so beneficial. Kennedy provided this example
because it illustrates the urge to communicate in order to fulfill two of the aforementioned
desires that drive all species of animal for a significant portion of their lives – to secure sex
and to preserve bodily health (through avoiding costly physical encounters by means of less
costly verbal and visual rhetoric).



– humans in the corporate world call them team
bonding exercises – through ritual and collective activity (Parrish, 2013, pp. 40–41). In what
they refer to as a “greeting ceremony,” Maynard Smith and Harper describe a common ritual
where African wild dogs gather to vocalize together, sound off as if in roll call, and initiate
play fights together, as Olympic wrestlers would do to warm up before a match (Maynard
Smith & Harper, 2003, p. 127). Making such boisterous displays could be a liability because
of the potential to alert large predators to the location of vulnerable dogs, but the epideictic
rituals pay off in unifying and preparing the pack for the demanding trials of endurance predation
(sometimes called persistence hunting). African wild dogs are not the fastest, strongest,
or largest species on the savannah, so much like early hominins they will often wear out their
prey by chasing them at low speeds over long distances. Whereas a human persistence hunter
can outdistance most prey animals that are better at short bursts of speed, the dogs need help
from other members of their pack. So they run a relay race of sorts, only they haven’t informed
their competitor ahead of time that the rules allow for a passing of the baton, so to speak. A
small number of dogs will identify and flush out a likely target, slowly herding it toward the
position of the next dogs down the line in a coordinated cross-country course. Once the prey
reaches the next dogs’ positions, they take over while the first group catches its breath. This
process of chasing and handing off the prey can go on for quite a few iterations, until the poor
animal is worn out and one member of the pack is able to hamstring it or otherwise cripple
the beast. Then the refreshed members of the pack will calmly trot in and help the victorious
group finish their prey in what is sadly not often the most merciful of deaths.
